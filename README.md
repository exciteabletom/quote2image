# quote2image
Generate cheesy inspirational quote messages using a nice user interface. 

This is still in very early development. I still have a lot of features I want to add and a lot of stuff isn't working at the moment.

Try it with the web interface at <a href="https://digitalnook.net/quote2image/">Digital Nook</a>

## Installing
Simply run `python -m pip install quote2image` to install the package. 

## Using the UI
Run the app with: `quote2image`.

## Using as a python library 
Import with: `from quote2image import generate`.

See `help(generate)` for documentation.
